## The Setup

It was Tuesday evening, and I had just finished a grueling study session. Exhausted but not quite ready for bed, I decided to unwind by checking out a few TikTok videos. My goal was to watch some quick entertaining content for about 15 minutes before getting back to my responsibilities.

## The Experience

I tapped the TikTok icon on my phone and was immediately directed to the For You page, where a video showing a famous tiktoker doing a trending dance challege. Curious for more, I swiped up to see the next video. The infinite scroll design made it effortless to keep going without any natural stopping points.
After watching several videos, I pulled down the notification bar to check the time and realized I had been scrolling for almost an hour. When I finally tried to stop, I found it difficult to disengage because how entertaining short videos are. There were no reminders or natural breaks—just an endless stream of videos. I expected some kind of notification or indicator, but there was nothing. This mismatch between my expectations and the app’s design made it all too easy to lose track of time and hard to put my phone down.

## UX Assessment

This experience highlighted the importance of **feedback**. Feedback refers to how a system communicates the result of a user's action. When I kept scrolling, there was no clear indication of how much time had passed or encouragement to take a break. If there had been a reminder or a summary of time spent, it would have helped me stay aware and in control.

Another major issue was the discrepancy between my **mental model** and how TikTok actually functions. My mental model was that I could take a quick break and easily stop after a few videos. In reality, the app's design made it much harder to disengage than I expected. This led to frustration and a poor sense of control over my experience.

## How It Could Be Improved

- Include a simple time awareness feature, like a pop-up or gentle reminder after a set period.
- Add a visual indicator of time spent or a "You've caught up" screen to create natural stopping points.
- Provide a brief onboarding or tip about how the infinite scroll works and how to set personal limits, helping users adjust their mental model before they get hooked.
