## The Setup

It was Tuesday evening, and I had just finished a grueling study session. Exhausted but not quite ready for bed, I decided to unwind by checking out a few TikTok videos. My **goal** was simple: watch some quick, entertaining content for about 15 minutes before getting back to my responsibilities.

## The Experience

I opened TikTok and was immediately greeted by a video playing automatically—this is where my planned 15-minute break began to unravel. The app launched directly into its **For You Page (FYP)**, a personalized feed that uses complex machine learning **algorithms** to deliver content tailored to my interests based on my previous interactions.

The **algorithm** is TikTok's method of selecting and presenting content by analyzing user behavior patterns to predict what will keep you engaged. In my case, it was frighteningly accurate. The first video showed a quick coding tutorial that solved a problem I didn't know I had. I watched it twice, then scrolled to the next.

The **infinite scroll** feature kicked in, a design pattern where content continuously loads as you scroll downward, removing any natural stopping points. Unlike platforms with pagination that create natural breaks in the user journey, TikTok's infinite scroll eliminates these boundaries, making it harder to disengage.

After scrolling through more and more posts, I realized I had been scrolling for nearly 40 minutes—far beyond my intended 15-minute break. This experience highlighted TikTok's strategic implementation of what designers call **persuasive design**—interface elements specifically crafted to influence user behavior, often by creating habit-forming patterns.

When I finally decided to stop, I noticed how difficult it was to actually put the phone down. The **variable reward system** at play—not knowing if the next video will be amazing or just okay, creates a psychological hook similar to slot machines. This unpredictability triggers dopamine release, making the experience highly addictive and hard to terminate voluntarily.

## The Outcome

I ultimately spent over an hour on TikTok—four times longer than intended. While the content was entertaining and the experience was superficially satisfying, I felt a sense of time wasted afterward.

From a UX perspective, TikTok excels at **engagement** but fails at respecting user **autonomy**—the ability for users to maintain control over their experience. The app prioritizes **sticky features** (elements designed to keep users on the platform longer) over helping users achieve their actual goals.

## Analysis & Recommendations

TikTok's interface is undeniably **effective** at captivating users, but its **efficiency** is questionable when considering users' broader life goals. While the interaction is streamlined for endless consumption, it lacks meaningful **feedback** about time spent or natural breaking points.

To improve the user experience while respecting user autonomy, TikTok could implement:

1. **Time awareness features** - Gentle reminders when users exceed their self-selected time limits
2. **Natural stopping points** - Occasional "You've caught up" screens that provide a moment to decide whether to continue
3. **Usage insights** - Visual representations of time spent daily/weekly, allowing users to make more informed decisions

These changes would maintain TikTok's engaging nature while improving its **user empowerment**—the extent to which an interface enables users to accomplish their true goals rather than the goals of the platform.

For my part, I've since adjusted my **mental model** of TikTok. A mental model is the user's understanding of how a system works based on their experiences and expectations. I now view it as a potentially open-ended commitment rather than a quick entertainment break, which helps me make more intentional decisions about when to engage with the app.
